doc = """The popularity of social media, online forums, and review websites has significantly contributed to the 
generation of a vast amount of textual data. Understanding and analyzing this data is crucial for multiple 
applications such as sentiment analysis, chatbot development, content moderation, and opinion mining. 
Among various complex tasks associated with text analytics, detecting sarcasm remains an arduous 
undertaking due to its ironic nature where words portray the opposite intended meaning. One often utilizes 
sarcasm as a means to express mirth, censure or disdain. A precise detection of sarcastic intent in written 
communication is pivotal for an accurate interpretation of the conveyed message.
Detecting sarcasm in text is a complex endeavor, as it hinges on many contextual factors and subtle 
linguistic clues that automated programs have difficulty interpreting. Moreover, sarcasm can exhibit marked 
variations across cultural and linguistic groups, posing additional challenges for modern natural language 
processing (NLP) tools. As large-scale textual data analysis attains greater prominence across various 
domains, developing accurate and effective models of sarcasm detection has become an increasingly 
pressing need"""
